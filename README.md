# predictive-dictionary -college project

   •	Implemented the TRIE data structure to provide the predictions.        
   •	The application searches the desired pattern by traversing throughout the n-way tree called TRIE

# Implementation of TRIE 

A common application of a trie is storing a predictive text or autocomplete dictionary, such as found on a mobile telephone. Such applications take advantage of a tries’ ability to quickly search for, insert, and delete entries.

# Implemention of LEVENSHTEIN DISTANCE Algorithm

It is a string metric for measuring the difference between two sequences. 
Informally, the Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits (i.e. insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other



# DATA SOURCE
1. few english words are kept in a text file (can be found in the project dir), which are treated as source of data.
2. audio of the pronounciation can be listened.                                                                                             
   PS: audio files for just four words have been kept in the repo but you can add .mp3 files for as many words as you want. :p
      "bus", "cat","cow","dog"
