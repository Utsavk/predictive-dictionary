Implementation of TRIE - data structure



1. few english words are kept in a text file (can be found in the project dir), which are treated as source of data.
2. audio of the pronounciation can be listened.                                                                                             
   PS: audio files for just four words have been kept :p
      "bus", "cat","cow","dog"
